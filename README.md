Oculus Rift DK2 Maze solving Game made with Unity3D

Built with Unity3D 4.6.1

### Instructions
You, Cyclops are faced with an unsolvable maze. Use your mutation to create paths where there are none and find your way to the treasure that awaits at the end of the maze.

### Controls:

- Movement: W, A, S, D
- Mouse: Look around
- DK2: Also, look around
- Fire laser beam from eye: LCtrl


### Issues:
- The laser beam, made of linerenderers does not display correctly in the build. The color and with are still default. Whereas Playing in unity gives a translucent red beam of appropriate width.

- Floor, SkyMap from Mecanim-GDC2013 (Unity Asset Store)
- Destructible Crate Asset from Unity Asset Store
- Treasure Chest Asset from Unity Asset Store
